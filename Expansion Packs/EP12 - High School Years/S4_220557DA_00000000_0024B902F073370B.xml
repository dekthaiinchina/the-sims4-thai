When Ernie was jumping distance to his bed, he leapt a mighty leap. In fact, he missed it clean and hit the headboard that his daddy made out of old slingshot ropes instead.

        <Source>This is a starter chandelier of sorts, made with strings of gems. These gemstones are quite vibrant and give a room a bright glow. Straight from the mines of Copperdale, the precious stones on this chandelier are remnants of the old mining days. Adorned with beautiful ores such as Plumbite and Lapis Lazuli, after which Plumbite Pier and Lake LaSuli are named after. This is a good step to adding simple elegance without having to spend Simoleons on a more upscale chandelier. Great for children's rooms, teens, or adults who want a youthful touch. Add a touch of historic Copperdale to your home!</Source>

What started as whispered accounts of sightings and curious explorations of the Copperdale Mines turned into a town-wide phenomenon that has flown straight into the hearts of the residents. The stories say the town's early settlers feared the mythic creature, but after saving a group of miners from a mine shaft collapse, he became a town hero! Others say he lurks under the pier and steals churros when Pier goers aren't looking and eats unsuspecting teen's homework around exam time. Wherever and whatever he is, he's a precious figure in Copperdale's history and is a must-see feature of Plumbite Pier.</Source>

        <Source>Jasper's story began as a small boy with big dreams of glittering hills and a prosperous industry. The desire to innovate and explore brought him to the valley where Copperdale sits today. After finding rich lines of Copper and Lapis Lazuli throughout the land, Jasper named the city and the lake it is nested on after its most abundant resources. 

But Jasper's life changed when he met something more precious than the ores he had mined for years. A young girl named Tia captured Jasper's heart with one glance. Jasper laid down his pickaxe and settled down with his true love in the hills of Copperdale, looking towards the town's bright future.

When his beloved Tia passed, Jasper retired to his home overlooking what is now Prescott square and kept a watchful and loving eye over the town. He lived out his days in peace, but some folks still say they can see Jasper on his porch at the BoomsBluff Mystery House in Prescott Square. </Source>

We have two periods, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, otherwise we give our students the freedom to interact and socialize with their peers and to study at their own pace. You'll be in Class 1, you should go find your teacher and say hello.

Keep in mind, there are exams every Friday. You can find your way to a computer to study for your exams, or even just pull out your notes and prep that way. Our faculty will also hold study sessions after school on Wednesdays.</Source>
        <Dest>Welcome to Copperdale High School {M0.Mr.}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}, I hope you settle in without too much trouble. We have two periods, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, otherwise we give our students the freedom to interact and socialize with their peers and to study at their own pace. You'll be in Class 1, you should go find your teacher and say hello.

        <Source>You must be {0.SimName}, welcome to my class! You want to hear about our curriculum? Well, I'd be happy to go over it with you!

Mondays:
Math is in the morning - Logical minds will thrive and do well here
Science is in the afternoon - Another place where logic will serve you well

Tuesdays:
Social Studies is in the morning - A writer honing their craft might find this class a breeze
Language Arts is in the afternoon - Another place where a writing mind will thrive

Wednesdays:
Art is in the morning - Someone with painting experience will perform well here
Computer Science is in the afternoon - A class where people practicing programming might hone their skill

Thursdays:
Business is in the morning - Charismatic Sims will have a leg up in this sort of classwork
Foreign Language - Charismatic Sims will also find themselves doing well here

Fridays:
Exams in both the morning and afternoons - The big moment when we'll see how well you've learned!

I'm sure that was a lot to take in. I'm sure you received some paperwork with our syllabus and class information. I'm sure if you checked your locker or somewhere on your person you'd find it. I look forward to the coming term with you {M0.Mr}{F0.Ms.} {0.SimLastName}</Source>
