        <Source>A series of paintings depicting the various key Brindletonians, all with some connection to Deadgrass Isle and the Tragedy of the Saint Bernard. Legend has it, in the earliest days of Brindleton Bay’s settlement, the citizens had no pets at all. The settlers had nothing to keep them entertained but tales of a plasma-sucking phantom that came in the night. One night, disaster struck. The Saint Bernard, a formidable ship to say the least, crashed headlong into the isle offshore and was lost to the waves. Mysteriously, lifeboats full of cats and dogs made their way to the shore, but there were no humans to be found. It is said that the Captain's ghost now roams the city at night, checking to make sure the ancestors of the pets that survived were given good homes, and that those lost in the crash are comfortably living out their nine afterlives on Deadgrass Isle.</Source>
        <Dest>A series of paintings depicting the various key Brindletonians, all with some connection to Deadgrass Isle and the Tragedy of the Saint Bernard. Legend has it, in the earliest days of Brindleton Bay’s settlement, the citizens had no pets at all. The settlers had nothing to keep them entertained but tales of a plasma-sucking phantom that came in the night. One night, disaster struck. The Saint Bernard, a formidable ship to say the least, crashed headlong into the isle offshore and was lost to the waves. Mysteriously, lifeboats full of cats and dogs made their way to the shore, but there were no humans to be found. It is said that the Captain's ghost now roams the city at night, checking to make sure the ancestors of the pets that survived were given good homes, and that those lost in the crash are comfortably living out their nine afterlives on Deadgrass Isle.</Dest>

Before their pets crashed ashore, Brindletonians had an enormous amount of free time that they spent tending to the fields and perfecting the covered bridge that overlooks Sable Square. Following the arrival of cats and dogs during the Tragedy of the Saint Bernard, the town's obsession with their new four-legged friends would lead them to erect huge monuments to cats and dogs throughout the square, and kick start a burgeoning fishing and pet food industry. Today, the town is thriving, with feline and canine influences woven directly into the community's DNA. The locals have even elected a cat as their mayor!</Source>
