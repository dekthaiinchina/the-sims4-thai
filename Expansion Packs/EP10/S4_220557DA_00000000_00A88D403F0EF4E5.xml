Never mind, this is only our second biggest door.</Source>
        <Dest>Sometimes you just need a big ole sliding door to block out the worries and cares of the world so you can retreat into your peaceful mountain abode. This shoji style sliding door is the biggest we've got! Door makers in the past have been asked if they could make them any bigger...and the truth is, we could, but have you ever tried to haul an over sized sliding door up a mountain? You have?! Oh. Well, in that case, maybe you should call our distributor because we're always looking for door Sherpas! But in the meantime, this is as big as they get. Wait, what's that? Oh okay. Never mind, this is only our second biggest door.</Dest>

Prepare a good group of climbers. They should all have at least level 6 rock climbing skill to have a chance of scaling the largest rock walls.

        <Source>Ah, so you have discovered the Magic Realm, traveler. Few can say as much. I dare not reveal all the realm's secrets, but there are a few notes of interest that might help you along your patch.

Seek out any of the three Sages within the Magic Headquarters to begin a magical journey. It is the balance of the three houses which keeps our realm together, otherwise we'd be torn apart by the vortex. On the outskirts of the main platform are various portals that you can explore. One portal leads to Casters Alley, which is a magical marketplace. Another to the dueling grounds, while the third leads to our gardens. That is all I will say.</Source>

        <Source>To some, Newcrest is just another suburb outside the city. To me, it's home. I can't think of a better place to raise a family. 

There's Llama Lagoon, which has a nice golf course and a public playground. Ridgeline Drive, which is perfect if you're looking for something more rustic. Lots of hiking trails on the edge of town. Bridgeview is closer to the city, but it's still very family friendly. Plus, it has a really nice picnic area.</Source>

There's no way you could see it all in one day. But let's see... The main things you'll want to check out are the festivals and the different districts.

You'll find the Flea Market and Spice Festival in the Spice Market. Then you have the Arts Quarter, which is home to the Humor and Hijinks Festival. The Fashion district is where you'll find GeekCon and the Romance Festival. And last but not least, Uptown, the heart of the city.

It's not uncommon for adventurers to visit, seeking treasure and ruins in the Omiscan ruins. It's pretty dangerous though. Some say the jungle is cursed.</Source>

First, you'll want to visit Wakaba, young leaves, at the base of the mountain. Try the vendor stalls, pick up information on the mountain, and maybe you'll catch the Festival of Youth. You can't leave before meeting our town mascot!

Halfway up is historical Senbamachi, our town of a thousand leaves. I'd recommend a hike through the bamboo forest or fishing. When the Festival of Light is being held, you'll find it there. 

At the peak is Yukimatsu, named for the snow covered pines in the area. That's where you can hit the slopes or go rock climbing, then visit the bathhouse to relax. It's also home of the world famous Snow Festival.</Source>

Now, if you're interested in something a bit more adventurous... you could always seek out the fabled Sylvan Glade. It's rumored that to find it, you have to befriend a magical tree. I'm sure that's all just superstition though.</Source>
