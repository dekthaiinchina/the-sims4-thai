        <Dest>{0.SimFirstName} was the best judge they'd ever had at the competition. Just. Wise. Artistically critical. There are those who say {F0.she}{M0.he} was born for such a role! Additionally, {M0.he}{F0.she} caught three cheaters. How do you cheat at a sandcastle competition? Just ask {0.SimName}.

Humbled to have such a legend amongst their ranks, the Beach Administration paid {0.SimFirstName} a bonus for gracing their competition.

The Mua Pel'am islander made no response, but the ex-first mate of Captain Handwich sniffed. &quot;A hot bath in the wooden tubs here cleans just as well,&quot; he disdainfully countered.

Morgan clenched the Sulani Island coin that beckoned her from across the seas.  She held it up and fire-light rippled across its face, a crashing wave. &quot;The work is always dirty, and we've just started,&quot; Morgan admonished. With a Sulani crew member translating her intentions, finding an ambitious island faction was straightforward. Handwich's crew was even easier to turn; the fool starved his crew then crashed his ship. Above all, Cordelia was the danger with her armada in range of Ohan'ali Town. She'll block off immediate sea routes when the parley goes south, but ships cannot sail over land.

Morgan turned to give the volcano maw one last look and final taunt. &quot;Your gaze lured me here, Sulani, so I return this to you. Tomorrow, I will have all of your eyes.&quot; She flipped the coin into the lava and watched as it was consumed.</Source>

        <Source>Princess Cordelia the Bold pondered her gift. Upon disembarking, a young islander girl ran to her with colored stones and a wicker brush. Now staring out a hut window across Lani St. Taz waters to the Sulani volcano beyond, she traced the wicker lines then finally ran it through her long hair. &quot;Not as elegant as carved ivory, but charming nonetheless.&quot;

&quot;I say again, Morgan will break parley to betray you.&quot; Captain Rodrigo De Pablo sat, sharpening his sabre. &quot;We are vulnerable. Let me bring the armada's forces ashore.&quot; His silhouette was imposing but his vision rarely reached beyond his weapon's range.

&lt;i&gt;Yes,&lt;/i&gt; Cordelia thought, &lt;i&gt;we are on the sword's edge, but how small the reward if we never up the ante. Dread Pirate Morgan has a ruthless reputation but is out-bluffed as Rodrigo if she's here only for the treasure hoard. The real treasure is the Sulani Islands themselves.&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;You &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; keep the armada as is; &lt;i&gt;armed and ready&lt;/i&gt; for the parley at the sun's high peak.&quot;

Rodrigo snorted, and Cordelia traced the lava flow as she continued brushing her hair.</Source>
        <Dest>Princess Cordelia the Bold pondered her gift. Upon disembarking, a young islander girl ran to her with colored stones and a wicker brush. Now staring out a hut window across Lani St. Taz waters to the Sulani volcano beyond, she traced the wicker lines then finally ran it through her long hair. &quot;Not as elegant as carved ivory, but charming nonetheless.&quot;

&quot;I say again, Morgan will break parley to betray you.&quot; Captain Rodrigo De Pablo sat, sharpening his sabre. &quot;We are vulnerable. Let me bring the armada's forces ashore.&quot; His silhouette was imposing but his vision rarely reached beyond his weapon's range.

        <Source>Sam felt for the pendant under his ruffled shirt, against his chest. When worry swelled in him, the pendant provided calm and solace. Tonight, he found himself reaching for it more than usual.

Around the Ohan'ali Town bonfire, the welcoming Sulani islanders sat and ate and laughed. Every so often, he'd catch a glance. &lt;i&gt;More pity than awe,&lt;/i&gt; Sam thought. &quot;Captain Samwell Handwich, your fortunes guide you like a rising star, &quot; he muttered while feeling more far away from Barnacle Bay and his life as a rising stage star where after one stirring performance, a child offered her heart, the pendant now around his neck. &quot;I'll treasure this always,&quot; he promised. &quot;What's your name?&quot;

&quot;Jocasta.&quot;

The parley was his last chance to regain what he'd lost. Being a pirate was unsurprisingly more difficult than acting as one. Vanity misguided his command, and when his ship crashed, the nearly starving crew abandoned him. Still, loss sharpened his focus, and the story of island treasure beyond imagination drove him. Surely, passionate appeals would sway the parley for a wealthy sum in his favor, much like audiences at his shows.

Anxiety rose in him again, and he reached for the pendant.</Source>

Fun fact: The first European to describe these plants was Philibert Commerçon, a botanist accompanying French Navy admiral Louis Antoine de Bougainville during his voyage of circumnavigation of the Earth, and first published by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789. It is also possible that the first European to observe these plants was Jeanne Baré, Commerçon's lover and assistant who was an expert in botany.</Source>

        <Source>This plant is the thing of legends...quite literally. It is said that two lovers, greatly devoted to each other, came to the attention of the Goddess Pele. Pele found the young man desirable and appeared before him as a beautiful stranger. But no matter what Pele did the lovers remained devoted to each other.

Angered, Pele chased the young man into the mountains, throwing molten lava at him. Pele's sisters witnessed this and to save the young man from a certain death they changed him into the mountain Naupaka. Pele immediately went after the young woman and chased her towards the sea - but again Pele's sisters stepped in and changed the young lover into beach Naupaka.

It is said that if the mountain Naupaka and beach Naupaka flowers are reunited, the two young lovers will be together again.

It wasn't until one quiet afternoon when Floaty met their first Sim that things changed. She was tiny. A little girl with big dreams. She and Floaty were instant friends! Together, they explored Sulani's perfect beaches, and together they learned of everything the island had to offer.

Perhaps the ocean was magnificent underneath the water's surface, but Floaty McWhaleface learned that there was an entire world to explore up above, and &lt;i&gt;more importantly&lt;/i&gt;... there were plenty of friendships to be made. </Source>

A common product is a mixture of cooked or fermented breadfruit mash mixed with coconut milk and baked in banana leaves. Whole fruits can be cooked in an open fire, then cored and filled with other foods, such as coconut milk, sugar and butter, cooked meats, or other fruits. The filled fruit can be cooked further so the flavor of the filling permeates the flesh of the breadfruit.

        <Source>The Snapper Security Window is the latest in island security. It works kinda like a rat trap. Crooks are attracted to an open window like a rat to a dumpster but when they try to climb in - SNAP! - The shutter drops down on the perp like the long arm of the law - trapping them instantly and securely. 5-0 is immediately alerted so, clean up’s a snap too. Just 3 minutes after the trap is sprung, the cops are at the window to drag that desperado off to the slammer. Remember, when the light is green, the trap is clean!</Source>

        <Dest>{0.SimFirstName} just received a very troubling phone call. The anti-environmentalist group &quot;Unenthuse About Conservation&quot; - who advocates for turning national parks into vacation homes - has started chaining off trails and dirt roads to block foot traffic. Even worse, it seems they received a permit to gather and even booked the grounds ahead of time!

{0.SimFirstName}'s field scientists can't get to their research grounds, and visitors are getting caught in the protest. Something must be done!</Dest>
