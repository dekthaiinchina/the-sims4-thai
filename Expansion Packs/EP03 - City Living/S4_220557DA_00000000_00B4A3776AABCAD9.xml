        <Source>Welcome to San Myshuno! This city is made up of four distinct districts: the Spice Market, the Fashion District, The Arts Quarter and Uptown.

In addition, Myshuno Meadows is a large city park tucked beneath the skyscrapers if your Sims need to get away for a touch of nature.

Depending on where your Sims choose to live, you’ll get a very different flavor of the city. You might find yourself in a cramped, roach-infested studio apartment in the Arts Quarter…  Or you might be enjoying a breathtaking view of the city from your very own tricked-out rooftop penthouse Jacuzzi in Uptown.</Source>
