        <Dest>Do you know the mill in Old New Henford? Many years ago, there was an accident - that poor Algernon Watson - and they shut it down to make sure everything was safe before letting anyone back in. But the strangest thing! That very night, the mill started turning again, all on its own. They went by the next morning and the door was locked from the inside! They've never shut the mill down since. I'd reckon they're afraid to now.</Dest>

        <Source>Want to hear my favorite Henford ghost story? It's the one about Maybell Watson. She was a local girl who used to ride her cute little bicycle around Old New Henford. It always had two fresh baskets of flowers, one on the front and one behind the seat. Maybell picked the flowers herself every morning down by the River Bagley. Well, one morning, she got up early before sunrise to go pick flowers like she did every other day. But on this day, she never came home and nobody ever saw her ever again. Some say she ran away, but others swear that if you look out over Olde Mill Lane in the early morning, you can see a bicycle with two flower baskets - one in the front and one in the back - riding itself along the dirt path, heading back up Olde Mill Hill, bringing the little Watson girl home.</Source>

        <Source>The entire line of Whittler's Pride kitchen furniture came to be after a century old whittling competition held in Old New Henford over a century ago between Oliver Jenkins and Jack Whittler. Of course, Jack Whittler won, teaching everyone that sometimes you really can judge a book by its cover... or in this case by its last name.
Everyone later learned that Jack Whittler had earned his last name in a previous whittling competition, which is how folk used to get last names back in those days. Jack went on to whittle plenty of other notable items around Henford-on-Bagley, but these kitchen counters were some of his finest work.</Source>

After it failed miserably due to frogs not being able to read calendars, cook, or speak, it became abandoned and items were auctioned off.

Besides, traffic was a mess on the 405 and by the time Smitty had clocked in, the sun was already breakin’ over the henhouse. Smitty had to act fast to get farmer Wilson out of bed in time to feed all the animals. So, he boldly kicked over the watering can, vaulted atop and crowed with everything he had. Farmer Wilson was so impressed by Smitty’s perseverance that he had a fountain built to mark the occasion. Yep, this is it.</Source>

        <Source>Forged in the early 1900s, this antique iron stove can cook anything you throw at it, from curries to crumpets. Though you probably shouldn't throw curries or crumpets around so frivolously. One-eyed Rob lost his eye due to a crumpet misfire, but that's a story for another day. Anyway, enjoy this tank-like behemoth of a cooker. They don't make 'em like they used to. </Source>

        <Source>Once a year, on ghost appreciation day, the tables at the Sir Conan O’Brian Arthur Doyle Inn at Barkersville get all dressed up in ghostly costume to revel in a truly unusual experience of the paranormal variety. The legend originated the night the tables turned on the good residents of Barkersville Manor. At the dinner hour, everyone had been seated and served around a large round table when a bone chilling scream rang out! It seems that Lady Doyle had ordered chips with her fish and had gotten mashed instead. That was what Sir Doyle had ordered. In fact everyone had been served the dish meant for the person to the right of them. Suddenly, the table bolted straight up off the ground, paused for a moment and slowly rotated slightly counter-clockwise and softly returned to the floor. Happy but a bit rattled, everyone enjoyed what they had ordered.</Source>

        <Source>This end table was salvaged from an old B&amp;B called The Frog's Wallow that was torn down years ago. It was previously owned by an eccentric dowager who left the estate to her pet frogs after she passed away. Her will stipulated that the frogs were to dress in clothing and run the B&amp;B. While the plan was quite whimsical on paper and drew in lots of business initially, people soon realized frogs are not well suited to run an establishment. Instead of tending to the daily duties of the inn, the frogs just sat around in ill-fitted suits, hopping around the premises and peeing on guests whenever they were picked up. Fun fact: frog pee is cold. There's something you don't learn in school.
Long story short, after the B&amp;B went under, all the furniture was auctioned off, including this adorable table.</Source>

        <Source>After the Great Sloth Invasion, Princess Cordelia was forced to flee her palace with few belongings and take refuge in the country. One of the first places she settled was Henford-on-Bagley. She spent lots of time enjoying the countryside, and a simpler way of life.
One such novel experience for her was the concept of going up and down stairs. In her palace, her family prided themselves on efficiency and so she always had a stair butler who carried her up and down stairs.
Since she had to fire all of her staff during the Great Sloth Invasion, unfortunately the stair butler could not join her in Henford-on-Bagley.
On the bright side, she experienced climbing this very set of stairs for the first time. She referred to them as &quot;peasant stairs&quot; and wrote about them in her diary. There's a first time for everything. And if you're in the market for a good stair-butler, hers is still looking for work.</Source>

Whether secreting a small surprise under Sophie the Snail, bringing an easel to paint the serene Cordelia Falls, foraging for wild mushrooms, or finding romance among the ruins on the Isle of Volpe, any Sim would be transformed by a day in the Bramblewood.</Source>
