Rohan will soon finish high school and have to make his final decision on what university he wants to attend.</Dest>

It was his laughter, tragically, that led to his untimely death during an exceptionally raucous pep rally.

Though legend has it, he never actually left his beloved university. Some say that if you listen closely you can still hear his eerie laughter echoing the halls of Britechester. It seems the Felix Psyded is still excited about life, even in death.</Source>

        <Source>&lt;b&gt;The Chilling Tale of Lobster Larry&lt;/b&gt;

Foxbury Institute's beloved Lobster Mascot is known as a lighthearted, loving and silly shellfish. Many would be shocked to learn of the unthinkable carnage from which his inspiration was derived.

Though neither lobster nor Komodo dragon are local to the area, one fateful day in early construction of the university, both beasts were brought together in a most ruthless showdown. As fate would have it, a freak monsoon at sea and a disastrous shipping mishap found both contenders smack in the middle of what is known today as the Foxbury Quad.

Having never encountered animals like each other in the wild before, their survival instincts took them swinging head-to-head in an epic crustaceo-lizard death match. Most of the horrified onlookers feared the tiny lobster was no match for the towering venomous dragon, but when all was said and done, it was the lobster who emerged the sole victor.

And so forever cemented the fierce rivalry between Dragon and Lobster.</Source>

        <Source>&lt;b&gt;The Mysteries of the Statues&lt;/b&gt;

There's a popular superstition about the iconic statues for The University of Britechester and The Foxbury Institute. It's rumored that If students offer the right kind of gifts to their respective statues, it could improve their luck with grades and academic success.

There's no perfect science to it, but high-quality or rare offerings of collectables like crystals, harvestables, metals, or desserts seem to be the best bet if you're looking to up your academic mojo.</Source>
        <Dest>&lt;b&gt;The Mysteries of the Statues&lt;/b&gt;

There's a popular superstition about the iconic statues for The University of Britechester and The Foxbury Institute. It's rumored that If students offer the right kind of gifts to their respective statues, it could improve their luck with grades and academic success.

        <Source>&lt;b&gt;The End of an Era&lt;/b&gt;

In The Order of Enchantment's second year, their founder Esther Mudget was speaking at a charity auction about the importance of using all-natural ingredients for baking.

Why she chose that discussion topic in the first place for this particular event is a separate mystery.

Midway through this infamous speech, Ms. Mudget abruptly and dramatically ran off into the woods, leaving the auction-goers baffled. 

It was later revealed internally among the Society that she had overused and betrayed the Sprites, seemingly ignoring their pleas for entertainment and starving them of the sugar they so craved. And all the while had been reaping the academic and social benefits they had bestowed on her. It was her greed and ignorance that ultimately led to her tragic downfall. As legend has it, she is still out there, forever lost, chasing after errant darts of light, hair in a tangled mess. No combs in sight.

Esther Mudget's fate serves as a reminder to revere and respect the Sprites lest you incur their wrath.</Source>

        <Source>&lt;b&gt;The Order's Origin&lt;/b&gt;

The Sprites on which the Origin of Enchantment's existence is based had been virtually undiscovered by humans until the turn of the century. A chance encounter with an energetic young scientist by the name of Esther Mudget changed the face of history forever. 

Esther had been studying the pollination patterns of wild mushrooms and her research brought her to Gibbs Hill. This is where she encountered the most fascinating spiral configuration of fungi behind the castle ruins. Intrigued, she began to spend increasingly more of her time there to study.

One afternoon, thanks to her polite new neighbors, she brought a slice of fresh fruitcake to the mushroom site. She set the cake on nearby rock while she went about her work. Before long, she started to hear a peculiar whistling sound. She knew this sound was not human, so her instincts told her to crack a corny joke in hopes of diffusing a bad situation.

Apparently the Sprites liked her joke. And they &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; liked her fruitcake.

The disarmed Sprites came out of hiding and allowed Esther to see them in their true twinkly form. They whispered wisecracks and the mysteries of the universe in her ears. Little did she know this would be the start of a tender, though ill-fated relationship.</Source>

After applying, Sims will soon receive their application results, which will inform them which distinguished degrees have accepted them as students. Having better high school grades or experience in relevant skills can be a big help in landing a spot in a distinguished degree program. If prospective students aren’t accepted into these programs, however, they are always welcome to earn any of the standard degrees.

Students may then enroll in their first term at our university via computer, or mailbox. The enrollment form will have them choose their university, degree, and housing, before whisking them off to the start of their higher learning adventure!</Source>

        <Source>If going to university seems like a financial burden, consider applying for scholarships that can help lower the costs dramatically! Teen and older Sims can apply for a large variety of scholarships, though each has different eligibility requirements.

Universities will automatically provide some money to Sims based on how impressive their application is – the more distinguished degrees they’re accepted into, the better the scholarship – but Sims are also encouraged to apply directly for need-based scholarships if their total funds are low, skill-based scholarships if their Sim has spent time building skills, career-based scholarships if they have workplace experience, sports and e-sports scholarships for Sims wanting to be on the team once they’ve enrolled, or grants relating to where they’re living.

Every scholarship a Sim wins will continue to help bring their costs down every term they’re in university as long as there is no gap between terms! Taking time off by not re-enrolling after a term ends will result in the loss of scholarships.</Source>
