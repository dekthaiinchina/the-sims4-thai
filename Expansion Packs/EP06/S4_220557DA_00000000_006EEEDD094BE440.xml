Trigger:
• Completing Dramatic Gigs in the Acting Career.

Behavior:
• The acting studio is not the place for pranks or jokes, especially for an actor trying to evoke the right emotion during a dramatic scene. Such behavior frays on the concentration of actors, and eventually they snap.

        <Source>Queen Louisa-Nanette's handmaids would lure Jacques into the main halls to ridicule him, but he did so willingly to chance a glance of Her Majesty as she flitted to and fro within the palace. Among his favored locations to evade prolonged unwanted attention was the Hall of Windows, where he would lure pursuers inside to be stymied looking for an escape path. Having discovered the escape route, Jacques would watch his hapless pursuers-turned-prey for a moment then continue his palace wanderings in search of his Queen.

Having grown bored of predictable palace layouts, The Queen commanded the construction of The Hall of Windows, an elaborate maze of halls and small chambers within the palace itself mostly comprised of this standard, medium-sized window in place of walls. Guests, usually at parties, would be challenged to enter the maze and escape before a certain time, with a wager agreed upon before-hand. Onlookers and escapee were able to see each other, with the latter's confidence shriveling to panic as the exit eluded them. The Queen would then step inside with Flur, her favorite kitten, trailing behind to provide a rescue. With many a bet won, Her Majesty collected a sizeable number of priceless but generally useless trinkets for only she knew, or so she thought, the true escape route.</Source>

On the other side, the object of his unrequited love reached down to pluck a thorny rose. As she brought the rose to her face, she peered at the window to see her reflection but gazed through it to see Jacques. Her eyes caught his, and with a smile, she beckoned him to her side.

At last, his chance to reveal his true self, a noble creature worthy of Her Royalty. As he stood before her, the Queen's radiance shone upon him like morning's first light upon dew-covered roses. Life, the world, paused eternally as he considered the words he longed to say to her. As he opened his mouth to finally speak, he instead belly-flopped into nearby mud around the thorny rosebush.

Long after the laugher subsided and Queen Louisa-Nanette with her entourage grown bored and left, he stood up, brushed off as much mud as he could, and peered at the faded Sim in the window. Jacques the Court Jester couldn't feel it, but tears streamed down the reflection's muddied cheeks.</Source>

As a B-Lister, you're well on your way to the top. In fact, the occasional paparazzi will confront you out in public. On the other hand, you now have genuine fans... Sims who are excited just to catch a glimpse of you!

Is all this public attention a bit overwhelming? Try using a mirror to wear a Celebrity Disguise. It'll give you cover to go about your life in privacy. However, you won't be able to earn any additional fame as long as you're disguised.

You're also at the point where your personal reputation can really impact the type of celebrity you become. If you've started to shape your Public Image around a Good or Bad reputation, additional Fame Perks are now available that will reinforce your positive or negative actions.</Source>

One star celebrities should continue advancing their career and skills to progress further into stardom. Interactions marked with &lt;font color='#199C2C'&gt;(+▰Fame)&lt;/font&gt; will let you know that you're on the right path.

They'll have earned their very first Fame Point, which can be spent on the Fame Perk of your choosing. Select the Fame Points button below to discover which Fame Perks are available.

Even minor celebrities are susceptible to developing a Fame Quirk. Quirks are behavioral oddities that are shaped by the actions a celebrity takes.</Source>

Hey there superstar! Kick back and take it easy, you're a top tier celebrity now. It's time to enjoy everything that you've accomplished!

You may have noticed during your rise to fame, that staying out of the public's eye could result in your fame slowly slipping away. Don't worry, as a five star celebrity, your fame is built to last. You'll have to outright ignore any actions that provide fame for days on end before you start to lose your status. Even then, you've built a lasting legacy... you'll never lose more than two stars of fame.

You've also accumulated a wide array of Fame Points, and likely purchased a number of Fame Perks. Perhaps it's time for a change? Use your phone to Book a Celebrity Cleanse. A short time later you'll wipe your slate clean, and have all your Fame Points refunded. This will allow you to select an entirely new selections of Perks to play with!</Source>

As a proper celebrity, you're practically... no wait, you're &lt;i&gt;literally&lt;/i&gt; a shining star. Don't fret, you can click on yourself and turn off your Fame Shine if it becomes a nuisance. 

You've also perfected a unique celebrity walkstyle that'll put all eyes on you. This too can be adjusted by simply clicking on your Sim.

        <Source>Having a positive reputation unlocks a number of benefits for your Sim...

If you're considered to be &quot;Good&quot;, you'll often form stronger starting friendships with new Sims that you introduce yourself to.

Upon reaching a &quot;Great&quot; reputation, your Sim will occasionally be offered various opportunities from other Sims such as getting invited to a Charity Benefit Party, receiving job offers that allow you to start a career at higher levels, getting set up on a blind date, and more. Romantic introductions you attempt will have a chance of starting you at higher relationship levels. You'll also automatically receive a boost to the scoring in any social events that your Sim hosts, making it easier to earn rewards.

Upon achieving a &quot;Pristine&quot; reputation, you'll be able to host your own Charity Benefit Party. This new event has a variety of new rewards to collect. Friendships you form will last longer, and Sims you pass by within the world will react positively to your mere presence.</Source>

        <Source>There are a few other details about your Sim's reputation to keep in mind...

Reputation can be affected by a Sim's fame. The more famous a Sim is, the faster their reputation can change. In addition, there are certain fame perks that require a positive or negative reputation to be able to unlock.
Finally, a Sim's reputation is never adjusted unless they're a current member of the active household that you're playing. If you play with different households of Sims, your Sim's reputation will be the same level where you left off when you swap back to a previously played household.</Source>

        <Source>Having a negative reputation will unlock a different range of benefits, and modify the types of Sims who react positively to you.

With a &quot;Bad&quot; reputation, introductions with new Sims aren't likely to go well... but if you happen to meet another Sim with bad reputation, or who happens to be Evil or Mean, you may find yourself with a stronger starting relationship.

When your reputation turns &quot;Awful&quot;, many new opportunities will occasionally occur. You might get invited to attend a Lampoon Party, receive an offer to join the Criminal career at a high rank, or be introduced to friends or romantic interests who also happen to be societal outcasts, and more.

Upon reaching an &quot;Atrocious&quot; reputation, you'll be able to host a Lampoon Party, where you can choose a guest of honor to roast. Sims around the world will react negatively as you walk by. Making friends can be difficult with this poor of a rep, but thankfully you can now bribe other Sims for their friendship, or for advancement opportunities in your career.</Source>

Simply going about your life isn't enough to form a reputation... A Sim must go out of their way to be kind or mean to have their reputation change.
